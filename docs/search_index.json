[["step-0-setup-and-defaults.html", "Chapter 3 Step 0: Setup and Defaults 3.1 Default Datasets: 3.2 Adjusting Default Code: 3.3 Default Settings:", " Chapter 3 Step 0: Setup and Defaults Please setup the appropriate workspace environment Please note that it is important to download our ADSNPheno code from https://github.com/daifengwanglab/adsnpheno onto your local computer or server, where you can access it. It is recommended that you work with the layout of our existing folders (with our data files and code). Then, you make adjustments as needed in the ADSNPheno folder, such as: adding your respective data files to the appropriate folders (please go to data folder) changing the parameters in the code based on your needs and requirements (by going to code &gt; userInputForEachStep) adapting our code to further suit your specific needs This is to help you adapt on our code as well, better understand the tools involved, and be more user-friendly. When you download our pipeline ADSNPheno, as a zip file(ADSNPheno-master.zip), it hopefully will come with the sub-folders shown above (such as the code and data folders). Please unzip the folder and then note the complete file path location of the unzipped folder, which will be the variable adsnphenoDirectory. For instance, on Saniyas computer, this ADSNPheno folder is located here: F://organizedAlzheimers//ADSNPheno//, so adsnphenoDirectory = F://organizedAlzheimers//ADSNPheno//. 3.1 Default Datasets: Please note that we have shared 3 data sources that we have used for our analysis, which we believe may be general-purpose and helpful references for you. These are also found in the dataDefaults folder (data \\(\\rightarrow\\) dataDefaults) and are information on: Entrez Mapping Information Transcription Factor Information Additional Gene Regulatory Information Please see these respective sections below for more information about these data files and on how to appropriately edit this information. For your convenience, these default data files have been saved as an RData object, which can be loaded with this command: load(&quot;data/generalDataForPipeline.RData&quot;) These data objects are then loaded, which are then used by the pipeline. 3.1.1 1. Entrez Mapping Information: To assist you with your gene set, please note that we have tried to build an extensive resource on some of the Entrez IDs for various genes so that you can map many genes to Entrez IDs. Please beware that Excel may distort some gene names like SEPT7 and MARC1 to numeric date values by mistake (we have tried to troubleshoot for some of those situations). It is not exhaustive, so please check additional sources such as NCBI for any genes you cannot find and make adjustments to this default data source, as needed, if you find any discrepancies. And, please email Saniya at skhullar2@wisc.edu, so she can update the files as needed (thanks for your help!). For many genes that begin with LOC, the entrez ID is often the numeric part of the gene name. This mapping will be used as a lookup in the pipeline to help with merging relationships, from disparate sources, reliably! Please note an example of some rows of our data//dataDefaults//entrezMappingInfo//infoDFMappingsGeneSymbolAndID.csv: someRows = c(1:5, 200:205)# 10 different rows of the CSV as an example dim(infoDF) # 59,307 rows and 2 columns ## [1] 58687 2 infoDF[someRows,] # geneSymbolName mapping to respective entrezIDs.

Transcription Factor Information: 3.1.3 3. Additional Gene Regulatory Information: Transcription Factor (TF) to Target Gene (TG) relationships based on TRRUST 2.0, which may serve as an additional source of TF-TG interactions. Information is also provided on some relationships and if the TF activates or represses the TG. Please note an example of some rows of our data//dataDefaults//additionalGeneRegulatoryInfo//Trrust2.csv. Here, CombinedName basically uses the gene symbol names and 2 pipes to represent the relationship: TF || RegulatedGene. Thus, the 1st row has AATF as the TF and CDKN1A as the RegulatedGene, so CombinedName will be AATF || CDKN1A dim(trrust2DF) # 9,395 rows of unique TF-TG relationships and these 5 columns (at least) are needed. ## [1] 9395 5 #head(trrust2DF) # the first 5 rows of the TRRUST2.0 data source. # TF RegulatedGene Source Info CombinedName # 1 AATF CDKN1A Trrust2 TRRUST2 (Regulation: Unknown) AATF || CDKN1A # 2 AATF KLK3 Trrust2 TRRUST2 (Regulation: Unknown) AATF || KLK3 # 3 AATF MYC Trrust2 TRRUST2 (Regulation: Activation) AATF || MYC # 4 AATF TP53 Trrust2 TRRUST2 (Regulation: Unknown) AATF || TP53 # 5 ABL1 BAX Trrust2 TRRUST2 (Regulation: Activation) ABL1 || BAX # 6 ABL1 BCL2 Trrust2 TRRUST2 (Regulation: Repression) ABL1 || BCL2 3.2 Adjusting Default Code: 3.3 Default Settings: Below, please note the main parameters to adjust (and please see step0_loadingInDefaultDatasets.R for additional parameters that may be varied) Variable Input Needed by You Description Default Value adsnphenoDirectory The region of the body that your gene expression data is for.
